# This project is for my blog for setting up wordpress site in ubuntu 

this project has also sql dump file attached  whuich need to be change according to server,


one very wrost thing we did  is we hardcoded the database password, which is unacceptable,
which we have fixed by getting passwords from AWS secret manager , or Azure key vault,
